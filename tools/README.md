# norikit/tools — org framework tooling

Dev-time scripts that keep the ecosystem consistent ("define once, derive everywhere").
Python 3.11+, stdlib only. They operate on the sibling repo checkouts under the org root
(`/…/norikit/<repo>`). **None of these are runtime dependencies of any tool.**

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **`sync_scaffold.py`** | Propagate `template`'s managed scaffold files (per `scaffold.manifest`) into every repo, preserving each repo's `norikit:project` region. | ✅ |
| **`gen_roster.py`** | Render the roster (`projects.md` + README table) from `ai-docs/projects.toml`. | ✅ |
| **`org_doctor.py`** | Cross-repo conformance check — composes roster + scaffold checks and token/badge/standalone scans. | ✅ |
| **`aggregate_docs.py`** | Compile each repo's `ai-docs/` (from origin/main) into a read-only `norikit/ecosystem/` mirror + index. | ✅ |

## sync_scaffold

```
python3 tools/sync_scaffold.py [--check] [--repos a,b,c]
```

- `--check` — report drift, change nothing, exit 1 if anything is out of sync (CI-friendly).
- `--repos` — limit to specific repos (default: all sibling git repos except `template`/`.github`).

**Modes** (declared in `scaffold.manifest`): `verbatim` (copy exactly) · `tree` (copy a directory
exactly) · `regions` (sync the `<!-- norikit:managed -->` block, **preserve** the repo's
`<!-- norikit:project:start/end -->` region).

**Migration safety:** a `regions` file that lacks the markers is reported `MIGRATE` and left
untouched — convert it by hand once (move its content into a `norikit:project` region), after which
sync maintains the managed block automatically.

## gen_roster

```
python3 tools/gen_roster.py [--check]
```

Renders `ai-docs/projects.md` (full) and the README roster table (between the `norikit:roster` markers)
from `ai-docs/projects.toml` — the single source of truth for the tool roster. `--check` exits 1 on drift.

## org_doctor

```
python3 tools/org_doctor.py
```

Runs every framework conformance check — **roster** · **scaffold** · **token leftovers** · **badges** ·
**standalone-first decision** — and prints a PASS/FAIL report, exiting 1 if anything is non-conformant.
Powers the scheduled org-doctor Action (Phase 7).

## aggregate_docs

```
python3 tools/aggregate_docs.py [--check]
```

Compiles each repo's `ai-docs/` (read from `origin/main`) into a read-only `norikit/ecosystem/` mirror
+ generated index — one place to read the whole ecosystem's design without cloning every repo. Source
of truth stays per-repo; every mirrored file carries a DO-NOT-EDIT header. `--check` exits 1 on drift.
(The scheduled Action should `git fetch` repos first so `origin/main` is current.)
